# DeepestDungeonScripts

My part of a student project from a master course at University Bayreuth that was done in a team of 5.
The aim of the project was to create a procedural 4 player Coop Shooter. My job on this project was to procedurally generate a futuristic 3D Network of flying Highways running through a city full of skyscrapers.

Other Team Members: Florian Amthor, Daniele Martinez, Dennis Quaisser, Jessica MÃ¤rz
